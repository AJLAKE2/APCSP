                <p>
                    This is a <q>p tag</q>. Its purpose is to indicate to a browser that this text is considered a paragraph. Different browsers will render this content in sightly differnt ways, so it is likely to look different between browsers. We can also verride the applied default styling by using css.
                </p>

                <div>
                    This is a div. Divs are generic tags that can apply to anything. Browsers generally do not apply any default styling to divs. Before HTMLS became the web standard, divs were used for virtually everything. Because they are so generic it is hard to target them with CSS to apply styling, so when HTMLS became the standard, many new tags were added that make styling and structure easier.

                        I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!
